description=This plugin manages the state of the EEPROM so that it will be correctly initialized prior to operations being executed.  This is important, for example, when sleeping/waking the chip.  The SPI or I2C bus must often be reinitialized.

# on boot.  Therefore we say 'false' here. The init is automatically called
# prior to executing other EEPROM calls.
